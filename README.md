# Developing a Personalized Recommendation Engine for E-commerce

Objective: The goal was to design an AI-driven Recommendation Engine for an e-commerce website, moving beyond the "most popular" items approach to provide personalized suggestions based on user behavior. The project aimed to demonstrate the engine's potential to increase sales and customer engagement through a more relevant shopping experience.

Data: The project utilized an Online Book RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) Dataset, conducting comprehensive descriptive statistics to understand customer purchasing patterns and segment them effectively.

Approach: Employing an unsupervised learning strategy, I segmented customers using the RFM model, categorizing them based on their interaction recency, purchase frequency, and spending habits. This segmentation enabled the creation of tailored marketing strategies and personalized recommendations for different customer groups.

Technical Highlights:

Conducted detailed descriptive analysis to explore data characteristics, including mean, standard deviation, median, and distribution patterns.
Developed and refined the dataset with descriptive labels to enhance data clarity and analysis readiness.
Applied the SMART framework to define project objectives, ensuring specificity, measurability, achievability, relevance, and time-bound criteria.
Implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation, ensuring each segment was mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
Created synthetic sample data to illustrate how new transactions would be scored and assigned to a segment, demonstrating the engine's operational capability.
Results: The Recommendation Engine effectively segmented customers, enabling personalized suggestions that are anticipated to increase user engagement and sales. Presented with an economic analysis, the solution convincingly illustrates its potential to the CMO and Webmaster, advocating for its implementation.
